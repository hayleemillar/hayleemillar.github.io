                    <p class="text-justify">
                        Roots is a subscription-based platform aimed to make subscription management to multiple independently-hosted websites easier.<br> Let's start with an example to clarify. You have subscriptions to a few different [fictitious] websites:
                        My News Today, Sewing Patterns, and Latest Video Games. Each of them are separately managed websites with different URLs and different subscription packages. With the current Internet offerings, each website would have their own
                        sign up system with a payment process attached. There would be no central way to manage or view your subscriptions to all of these websites at once. With Roots, users have access to a platform where they can manage existing subscriptions
                        and also explore for new ones. The burden is taken off of the user with easier management tools.

                        The goal of this project is to determine the proper design for user subscription management because if the user experience is poor, then the entire platform will fail.

                <h3>Content Creators & Digital Media</h3>
                <p class="text-justify">
                    Since the birth of the World Wide Web in 1993, digital media has been a part of the Internet landscape. Digital media can be defined as some form of either information or entertainment with the aim of being consumed by others through technological means
                    like computers, tablets, and cellphones. It is in the 90s when traditional analog media like radios and magazines fell to give way for other forms of entertainment on the Internet. Media has transformed to include audio, video, social
                    media, advertising, news, literature, as well as others [3].
                </p>
                <p class="text-justify">
                    For companies to be successful in regards to their digital media, they must find a way to gain revenue. The first step is to ensure there is a following for the work being created. A substantial following can be achieved through interacting with users
                    on various social media platforms and running advertisement (ad) campaigns. Once an interest for the media has been established and an audience has been built, the next step is monetization [5].
                </p>
                <h3>Why Subscription-based?</h3>
                <p class="text-justify">
                    There is an abundance of free media available on the Internet. Thus, creators of digital media must compete with a very low reference for the price point of comparison if they wish to monetize their content [9]. In such a free-centric environment creators
                    are left with two main models: advertisement-based and subscription-based.</p>
                <p class="text-justify">
                    Online advertising, which made up 41% of all advertising in 2017, has become a very common part of the Internet. Their appeal is high in the fact users are not required to provide monetary compensation to receive content. Instead, the user’s attention
                    is the commodity. When websites launch ad campaigns, their ads are then displayed to a choice set of users throughout a website’s content on other participating websites. The very nature of sprinkling ads within and beside content
                    competes against the creator’s content for the user’s attention. The ad could be interesting to the user, or it could be irritating, but is still nonetheless decidedly distracting. Ads are usually not totally random, but they can be
                    repetitive. It is not uncommon to use repetition as a tactic for capturing the user’s attention, which can become annoying if the ad is of no interest to the user [4].
                </p>
                <div class="media-object text-center">
                    <div class="media-object-section" style="margin:0 auto">
                        <div class="thumbnail">
                            <img src="assets/imgs/hcc/search-pizza.png" alt="google ads" style="width:40rem;"></img>
                        </div>
                    </div>
                </div>
                <p class="text-justify" style="width:40rem;margin:0 auto;margin-bottom:20px;"><em>Source: https://www.google.com/</em>. An example of distracting ads. The results list is not viewable on initial page load, only ads are.</p>
                <p class="text-justify">
                    The other option is a subscription-based model, where users pay some recurring fee in return for online content. The user’s whole attention is on the media without any ad distractions. User experience becomes improved while maintaining a viable business
                    model. However, as previously mentioned, consumers of online content are often unwilling to pay for content due to vast amounts of free media online [9]. With time and enough user support, subscription-supported content can become
                    more widely accepted by Internet users.
                </p>

                <p class="text-justify">
                    The subscription-based model is the focus of this thesis, as advertisements have become more and more ineffective as time has progressed. It is clear there is potential to make a profit from it but not to what degree [4]. Using traditional practices to
                    place ads within content, the ads can become intrusive and degrading to the user experience. The problem not only lies within the model itself, though; Internet users have begun using 3rd party ad blockers to personally improve their
                    experience. Such use of blockers leads to a loss in income through ads, as they are no longer being seen or clicked on by users. Without user clicks, the ads are not creating a monetary return. Considering the drawbacks and resistance
                    against using ads, the primary model for this project is a subscription model.

                <h3>Existing Platforms & Their Pitfalls</h3>
                <p class="text-justify">
                    Popular websites like Patreon, Memberful, and Podia exist on the Internet as ways to monetize digital content through a subscription model. Patreon is a platform that has accrued over 100,000 content creators. Each creator has their own page on Patreon
                    where they post content like videos, podcasts, and blogs. Patreon has three tiers for creators to choose from. The lowest tier is a 5% transaction fee plus payment processing, which offers a landing page for the creator, communication
                    (email, direct messaging), and free workshop videos. The middle tier is an 8% transaction fee plus payment processing, which offers the above plus membership tiers, analytics, the ability to offer limited-time deals, live-streamed
                    workshops from creators, integration of other apps (like Facebook, for example), and priority customer support. The top tier of Patreon is a 12% transaction fee plus payment processing, which offers the above plus a dedicated partner
                    manager (a Patreon employee), the ability to sell merchandise, and multiple accounts for the ability to accommodate a team [7].
                </p>
                <p class="text-justify">
                    Patreon bears a few issues as a platform in the scope of the goals of this project. The first is it restricts creators from presenting their content the exact way they please. Every creators’ page is white with the same minimal orange accents. Oftentimes
                    it is difficult to distinguish between posts because of the lack of color contrast. Second, the creators’ posts may only be viewed in a linear format, each post being contained in a card. While this linear layout may be filtered in
                    different ways, there is no explicit way to search through a creator’s content. If creators had the ability to manage and create their page exactly the way they wanted it to be, they could include a search feature if they felt it necessary.

                <p class="text-justify">
                    Memberful, a Patreon company, provides a technology that integrates into the creator’s website, WordPress or self-hosted, and has three different pricing plans. The <em>Starter</em> plan ($0/month + 10% transaction fee) allows creators
                    to have 2 plans (essentially websites), and free website integrations. The <em>Pro</em> plan ($25/month + 4.9% transaction fee) allows creators have unlimited plans, all service integrations (Mailchimp, Discourse, etc.), ability to
                    have coupon codes, multiple accounts to accommodate a team, enable a free member tier, analytics, API+ webhooks, and custom branding. The <em>Premium</em> plan ($200/month + 4.9% transaction fee) allows creators to have all of the
                    above plus the ability to sell group subscriptions (for example, to an organization of sorts) and the removal of all Memberful branding [6]. Memberful is the closest technology to the one to be proposed, but it misses the ease of user
                    experience on the Internet on a larger scale. If users had one platform to manage their subscriptions to their favorite content creators’ websites, like Patreon does with their creator pages, then they are able to consume content more
                    easily, thus enhancing the user experience. Users might be more willing to spend their money and contribute to creators if they can have an overview of their overall subscription spending.

                    Podia is similar to Patreon such that content creators have their websites hosted through Podia. There are over 25,000 content creators that use Podia. It has two different pricing plans. The <em>Mover</em> ($39/month) allows creators
                    to have their own page, communication (email, direct messaging), unlimited hosting, free migrations, 7 days/week customer service, and online courses/downloads for additional help. The <em>Shaker</em> ($79/month) allows creators to
                    have in addition to the above-mentioned the ability to implement membership subscriptions, a blog, embedded checkout, affiliate marketing, and the ability to use 3rd party code. Podia differs from Patreon in the way it has no transaction
                    fees. The downfall to Podia is the creator cannot choose where their website is hosted. Since Podia handles the hosting, creators have no way to quickly access or manage their website [8].

                    No current platform makes the subscription model easy for the media consumer while also keeping the media ownership rights with the creator. The following proposed platform will include a central site for users to easily manage their subscriptions to
                    creators’ websites. Users will also be more aware of their payment information being held by only one company. If a user is on a <em>Premium</em> Memberful website, there is no Memberful branding. The user may not
                    fully be aware of who has their payment information. If users had a central place to manage subscriptions, the ambiguity would be lifted. As for the content creators, the proposed platform will appeal to those who wish to have more
                    control and ownership over their media, not just the creation of the content. Patreon is better suited for such creators who desire to strictly produce content. Those who desire more involvement and for their users to have a more streamlined

                <h3>Web Accessibility</h3>
                <p class="text-justify">
                    The Internet is infamous for not considering diversity within the human race. This has led to a prominence of poor designs. Blind users are among the most affected despite the advancements in screen readers [1].
                </p>
                <p class="text-justify">
                    While the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) were created by the Web Accessibility Initiative of the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) to promote accessibility and inclusivity, WCAG 2.0 only covers about half of the various issues found by blind
                    users [1]. Wille et. al provide structured ways to assess accessibility based on their user tests and associated research. WCAG provides a great base for all websites to start with and then continue from there [10].
                </p>
                <p class="text-justify">
                    It should be noted that blind user experience should also be considered in a holistic manner due to both objective and subjective qualities about the overall user experience. Aizpurua et. al studied 11 participants of varying expertise using screen readers
                    to interact with the Internet. They were particularly interested in the perceived Web accessibility (PWA), finding UX attributes to be highly connected to PWA. Researchers found feelings like interest and frustration to be more familiar
                    to users and revealed as what they used for PWA, particularly for blind people [1].
                </p>
                <p class="text-justify">
                    The Title III of the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) has long left out the nonphysical realm of the Internet in its considerations. The ADA only applies to physical places. Shah argues online content is a critical missing component to the ADA and
                    must be considered, whether that be strictly to the ADA as it is written or through a more general interpretation of it. Changing the way the guidelines are interpreted are critical for users of different abilities that wish to use
                    the Internet, as the current tests fail to account for online content [2].
                </p>
                <p class="text-jusstify">
                    After considering the research done on accessibility, it has been determined to focus mostly on holistic practices for this project. While the WCAG should be considered in future iterations, the tests conducted for this project will provide as preliminary
                    research.

                <h2 id="proposed-platform">Proposed Platform</h2>
                <p class="text-justify">
                    The central component of the proposed platform is a website where both users and content creators can manage their accounts. Users will be able to view and easily manage their subscriptions to creators on the platform. In addition, they will be able to
                    search through descriptions and small landing pages for creators to find new media they like. Users also will be able to manage their payment information on the platform’s website, allowing them to know their sensitive information
                    is being held by only one company. Creators will only have access to basic user information of those who are subscribed to them.
                </p>
                <p class="text-justify">
                    The platform will allow creators to manage their account information and landing page. Help pages and customer service via e-mail would also be provided, similarly to the platforms described in the background section. Other than the main website for account
                    management, creators have full control over their websites. The only requirement is for creators to ensure on their website a way to determine if users are authorized to view certain content. The platform will provide code snippets
                    and support, taking great care not to invade the creator’s space any further.
                </p>
                <p class="text-justify">
                    Effort will also be taken to make sure the website is accessible according to the standards set forth and specified.

                <p class="text-justify">
                    One main component of concern for design is the management of content subscriptions for users. If subscriptions are not easy to add, edit, and remove, then the website will be rendered fairly useless. Its strength lies in users being able to see the aggregated
                    list and making informed decisions based off of it. They may want to know how much they are spending on each subscription, or how many they might have. Nevertheless, it is a design consideration that needs to be made and will be the
                    main focus of the tests.

                <h3>Methodology</h3>
                <p>
                    The following test was an exploratory test accompanied by two open-ended questions. Such an approach was made to better understand the desired design and what users are looking for in a subscription list. Unhindered by current platforms, the research
                    questions aim to distinguish the design properties that are mosts apparent to users in a basic sense rather than build upon existent practices.

                <p class="text-justify">
                    Roots's subscription management design was usability tested by 2 participants on December 1st, 2020.<br> The primary purpose of this user experience test was to explore the initial design for managing a set up subscriptions to different
                    content creators. An initial design was determined, and then the participants were requested to give their open-ended opinion on what they liked or what they would like to see in a future design after a set of tasks.<br> The results
                    of the test showed the initial design has potential but they left room for a desire for more information from the user. While one participant praised the simple yet effective design of Roots, another wished there was more information
                    present about the types of options they could choose from a creator.<br> Overall, participants were satisfied with the user experience but are looking for future improvements to be made, as reflected in the responses to the summary
                    question 1 from the end-of-study (SUS) questionnaire: I think that I would frequently use the platform. Each “P” in this graph represents one participant, such as “P1” is Participant 1:

                <p class="text-justify">
                    This is the report of a test of the user experience of the Roots product. It is a “test” instead of an “inspection,” because the people doing the testing were representative of the population of users, instead of being user experience experts. It is a
                    “test” instead of a “study,” because this test was an informal controlled, observation of users using the product in defined scenarios. The broader term “study” applies to a variety of approaches, not just tests. For more background

                <h5>2.2 Product Description</h5>
                <p class="text-justify">
                    The central component of Roots is a website where both users and content creators can manage their accounts. Users will be able to view and easily manage their subscriptions to creators on Roots. In addition, they will be able to search through descriptions
                    and small landing pages for creators to find new media they like. Users also will be able to manage their payment information on the platform’s website, allowing them to know their sensitive information is being held by only one company.
                    Creators will only have access to basic user information of those who are subscribed to them. The platform will allow creators to manage their account information and landing page. Help pages and customer service via e-mail would also
                    be provided, similarly to the platforms described in the background section. Other than the main website for account management, creators have full control over their websites. The only requirement is for creators to ensure on their
                    website a way to determine if users are authorized to view certain content. Roots will provide code snippets and support, taking great care not to invade the creator’s space any further.<br> Specifically, for this
                    test, the researcher desired to create a preliminary design and see how participants respond to it and what the participants themselves want to see in a future design.
                </p>

                <p class="text-justify">
                    The goals described in this section drove our choice of the tasks that we used as context for our user experience inspection.

                    All users tried all tasks, because users were not asked to do tasks for which they lacked all the relevant domain knowledge. But users who had some experience with a task's domain were asked to do portions of the task, and were coached through some other
                    parts of the task just to see how well an inexperienced person would do.<br> Table 1 lists the task changes for each participant. (The participants are described in section 3.2 Participants.)

                <p class="text-justify">cd The target user population was users who use the Internet to consume media content supported by a subscription model. But it was hard to get such participants, because while the users consume media online, they did not pay for it. To
                    simulate moderate experience with the GUI, we gave all participants a Quick Start Guide before the first task. For a listing of which tasks the participants skipped due to lack of expertise whatin the domains, see Table 1, above.
                </p>
                <h5>3.3 Test Environment</h5>
                <p class="text-justify">
                    The test was done in the participants' homes, using 2019 Macbook Pro running MacOS Catalina.<br> The display resolution was 3072 x 1920. That is higher than the resolution many real users will have.<br> The test administrator was the
                    only researcher and expert in the room.<br> The screen recordings taken for this project are to be deleted off the researcher's laptop after submission of the tapes to the professor of the course. They will not be seen or shared with
                    anyone other than the researcher and professor.<br> The GUI was a preliminary version, so it still had bugs, incompleteness, noncompliance with the UE req-spec, and noncompliance with the MCT style guide.
                </p>
                <h5>3.4 Test Administrator Tools</h5>
                <p class="text-justify">
                    The test adminstrator followed the script in section 10 Appendix: Script. Each participant completed a short questionnaire after each task, reading the questions and completing online forms themselves. At the end of the session the participants completed
                    a similar questionnaire for the entire test.
                </p>
                <h5>3.5 Test Design</h5>
                <p class="text-justify">
                    There was no split into different test conditions. All participants were treated the same. Participants all were given the same tasks, except that all or parts of tasks were skipped for participants who lacked necessary domain knowledge (see list of those
                    in the Tasks section).<br> Each participant was comfortable due to being in their own home space, then was sat down in front of the computer in the participant room. The test administrator gave the introductory
                    instructions and orientation that are listed in the first pages of the script. Then the participants read and consented on their preliminary form.

                    To discover what to fix: Skim to find the Recommendations. They are easy to find, because they are all in tables. Start with the highest priority ones, which are tagged Red. If you care about the reason for a recommendation, look for the Finding tags
                    (e.g., “F1”) in the “Finding” column of that recommendation’s row, and look above the recommendation table to read that finding. Some findings will be in other places in the document, but they are easy to locate because they are sequentially
                    numbered.
                    <br> To discover what is wrong and right: Skim to find the Findings. They are above their associated tables of recommendations. Each Finding begins with the boldfaced word “Finding,” followed by the finding’s identification number
                    (e.g., “F1”) and the finding’s priority. Start with the highest priority ones, which are tagged Red. Details about the finding are in paragraphs indented under the initial short, boldfaced description. If you care about what to fix
                    or preserve, look in the Recommendations tables for recommendations having that finding’s identification number in the “Findings” column.<br> Descriptions of the priority color codings are at the start of section 4.2 Findings & Recommendations.

                <p class="text-justify">

                <h5>5.3 How to Write This Document</h5>
                <p class="text-justify">
                    This document is based on a template created by Tom Dayton. The template has numerous format settings that can make your authoring job easier, if you follow the instructions in this section.<br> Add findings and recommendations by
                    copying existing ones and then modifying them! That will preserve the formatting such as the numbering, so you don’t have to do it the laborious, manual way.<br> The Finding numbers (“F1”) outside the table are assigned automatically
                    in sequence. But within the table’s Findings column, you must manually type the numbers as references to existing findings. I (Tom) haven’t figured out how to have those references to an existing finding change automatically to reflect
                    the original finding’s changing number.<br> Use the paragraph styles that are used in this document already, such as Header 1, Header 2, and Body Text. If in doubt how to do that, copy an existing item (including its end-of-paragraph
                    marker, which contains the style information) and modify that copy.

                <p class="text-justify">The list-style design to display all subscriptions a user has at once seems to be well-received by the participants and should remain in the design. The design for the subscription tier cards, however, need more consideration in the next
                    iteration. Care should also be taken to ensure the next iteration remains simple and easy to use.</p>

                <h3>Methodology</h3>
                <p>
                    The following test was an exploratory test accompanied by two open-ended questions. Such an approach was made to better understand the desired design and what users are looking for in a subscription list. Unhindered by current platforms, the research
                    questions aim to distinguish the design properties that are mosts apparent to users in a basic sense rather than build upon existent practices.

                <h4>1 Summary</h4>
                <p class="text-justify">
                    Roots's subscription management design was usability tested by 2 participants on December 8th, 2020.<br> The primary purpose of this user experience test was to explore the second design for managing a set up subscriptions to different
                    content creators. An second design was determined after an initial user test, and then the participants were requested to give their open-ended opinion on what they liked or what they would like to see in a future design after a set
                    of tasks.<br> The results of the test showed the second design has potential but they left room for a desire for more information from the user. Both users found the platform easy to navigate and simple. The first participant noted
                    the cog wheel and expand logo for the website subscription list may not be immediately obvious to less tech-savvy users. The same participant also voiced concern about the amount of information presented within subscription tier cards.
                    Desire from participants for more information in such cards seems to be consistent across both the first and second user tests.<br> Overall, participants did not seem to feel particularly in favor or against using the platform, as
                    reflected in the responses to the summary question 1 from the end-of-study (SUS) questionnaire: I think that I would frequently use the platform. Each “P” in this graph represents one participant, such as “P1” is Participant 1:

                <h4>2 Objectives and Scope</h4>
                <p class="text-justify">
                    This is the report of a test of the user experience of the Roots product. It is a “test” instead of an “inspection,” because the people doing the testing were representative of the population of users, instead of being user experience experts. It is a
                    “test” instead of a “study,” because this test was an informal controlled, observation of users using the product in defined scenarios. The broader term “study” applies to a variety of approaches, not just tests. For more background
                    on this document, see section 5 About This Document, especially section 5.1 How To Use This Document.

                <h5>2.1 Our Goals For This Test</h5>
                <p class="text-justify">
                    The primary goal of this user experience inspection was to suggest improvements to the Roots's user subscription management, providing those suggestions by December 9th 2020 so there would be time to incorporate those changes in the next version of the
                    product. This inspection addressed only the subscription management aspects of the product. The inspection examined the product’s:
                    <ul>
                        <li>Usefulness</li>
                        <li>Usability</li>
                        <li>Conformance with the User Experience Requirements and Specifications document for this product.</li>
                    </ul>
                </p>
                <h5>2.2 Product Description</h5>
                <p class="text-justify">
                    The central component of Roots is a website where both users and content creators can manage their accounts. Users will be able to view and easily manage their subscriptions to creators on Roots. In addition, they will be able to search through descriptions
                    and small landing pages for creators to find new media they like. Users also will be able to manage their payment information on the platform’s website, allowing them to know their sensitive information is being held by only one company.
                    Creators will only have access to basic user information of those who are subscribed to them. The platform will allow creators to manage their account information and landing page. Help pages and customer service via e-mail would also
                    be provided, similarly to the platforms described in the background section. Other than the main website for account management, creators have full control over their websites. The only requirement is for creators to ensure on their
                    website a way to determine if users are authorized to view certain content. Roots will provide code snippets and support, taking great care not to invade the creator’s space any further.<br> Specifically, for this
                    test, the researcher desired to create a preliminary design and see how participants respond to it and what the participants themselves want to see in a future design.
                </p>
                <h5>2.3 Intended User Goals for the Roots Product</h5>
                <p class="text-justify">
                    The goals described in this section drove our choice of the tasks that we used as context for our user experience inspection.
                    <ul>
                        <li>Determine & test initial design for a list of subscriptions.</li>
                        <li>Determine & test initial design of how a user navigates to a specific subscription page.</li>
                        <li>Determine & test initial design of how a user manages a specific subscription.</li>

                    All users tried all tasks, because users were not asked to do tasks for which they lacked all the relevant domain knowledge. But users who had some experience with a task's domain were asked to do portions of the task, and were coached through some other
                    parts of the task just to see how well an inexperienced person would do.<br> Table 1 lists the task changes for each participant. (The participants are described in section 3.2 Participants.)

                <p class="text-justify">
                    The target user population was users who use the Internet to consume media content supported by a subscription model. Both participants consumed online subscription media-- one monthly and the other weekly. To simulate moderate experience with the GUI,
                    we gave all participants a Quick Start Guide before the first task. For a listing of which tasks the participants skipped due to lack of expertise in the domains, see Table 1, above.
                </p>
                <h5>3.3 Test Environment</h5>
                <p class="text-justify">
                    The test was done in the participants' workplace, using 2019 Macbook Pro running MacOS Catalina.<br> The display resolution was 3072 x 1920. That is higher than the resolution many real users will have.<br> The test administrator was
                    the only researcher and expert in the room.<br> The screen recordings taken for this project are to be deleted off the researcher's laptop after submission of the tapes to the professor of the course. They will not be seen or shared
                    with anyone other than the researcher and professor.<br> The GUI was a preliminary version, so it still had bugs, incompleteness, noncompliance with the UE req-spec, and noncompliance with the MCT style guide.
                </p>
                <h5>3.4 Test Administrator Tools</h5>
                <p class="text-justify">
                    The test adminstrator followed the script in section 10 Appendix: Script. Each participant completed a short questionnaire after each task, reading the questions and completing online forms themselves. At the end of the session the participants completed
                    a similar questionnaire for the entire test.
                </p>
                <h5>3.5 Test Design</h5>
                <p class="text-justify">
                    There was no split into different test conditions. All participants were treated the same. Participants all were given the same tasks, except that all or parts of tasks were skipped for participants who lacked necessary domain knowledge (see list of those
                    in the Tasks section).<br> Each participant was comfortable due to being in their own home space, then was sat down in front of the computer in the participant room. The test administrator gave the introductory
                    instructions and orientation that are listed in the first pages of the script. Then the participants read and consented on their preliminary form.

                <h5>5.1 How to use this document</h5>
                <p class="text-justify">
                    To discover what to fix: Skim to find the Recommendations. They are easy to find, because they are all in tables. Start with the highest priority ones, which are tagged Red. If you care about the reason for a recommendation, look for the Finding tags
                    (e.g., “F1”) in the “Finding” column of that recommendation’s row, and look above the recommendation table to read that finding. Some findings will be in other places in the document, but they are easy to locate because they are sequentially
                    numbered.
                    <br> To discover what is wrong and right: Skim to find the Findings. They are above their associated tables of recommendations. Each Finding begins with the boldfaced word “Finding,” followed by the finding’s identification number
                    (e.g., “F1”) and the finding’s priority. Start with the highest priority ones, which are tagged Red. Details about the finding are in paragraphs indented under the initial short, boldfaced description. If you care about what to fix
                    or preserve, look in the Recommendations tables for recommendations having that finding’s identification number in the “Findings” column.<br> Descriptions of the priority color codings are at the start of section 4.2 Findings & Recommendations.
                </p>
                <h5>5.2 Target Audience for This Document</h5>
                <p class="text-justify">
                    The audience for this document is usability (user experience) specialists, system engineers (who write system reqs and specs), developers, testers, and technical writers.
                </p>
                <h5>5.3 How to Write This Document</h5>
                <p class="text-justify">
                    This document is based on a template created by Tom Dayton. The template has numerous format settings that can make your authoring job easier, if you follow the instructions in this section.<br> Add findings and recommendations by
                    copying existing ones and then modifying them! That will preserve the formatting such as the numbering, so you don’t have to do it the laborious, manual way.<br> The Finding numbers (“F1”) outside the table are assigned automatically
                    in sequence. But within the table’s Findings column, you must manually type the numbers as references to existing findings. I (Tom) haven’t figured out how to have those references to an existing finding change automatically to reflect
                    the original finding’s changing number.<br> Use the paragraph styles that are used in this document already, such as Header 1, Header 2, and Body Text. If in doubt how to do that, copy an existing item (including its end-of-paragraph
                    marker, which contains the style information) and modify that copy.

                <hr style="margin-left:0;">
                <p class="text-justify">
                    The overall results showed participants found the platform to be relatively simple to use. While not all saw themselves using the platform personally, there did not seem to be a learning barrier involved. A few of the participants praised the simplicity
                    and emphasized that as the reasoning behind why they liked the design. Another two participants, one from each user test, expressed desire for more verbose tier descriptions. One mentioned using a dropdown or pop up to provide the
                    user with more information. Participant 1 from the second test also emphasized the need for tooltips as certain button logos may not be readily apparent to all users. Tooltips would suggest to users what the button is for so they can
                    make better informed actions.

                <hr style="margin-left:0;">
                <p class="text-justify">
                    Following the thoughts of the participants, there are two major design recommendations. The first is for proper tooltips for buttons that are not text. This will allow confused user know what the signifier (logo) for the button means. The second design
                    recommendation is to further design the subscription tier cards. Participants suggested more verbose explanations for tiers, and to design a pop up or drop down that provides an extended explanation.

                <hr style="margin-left:0;">
                <p class="text-justify">
                    The design of the subscription management portion of the platform was simple and easy for participants to use. A future design will include tooltips and a redesign of the subscription tier cards. This project was limited to participants the researcher
                    knew. The number of participants in each study was also small, making the results more difficult to generalize to a population. Nevertheless, the participants' feedback will aid in further development of the platform.
